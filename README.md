# Frontend Developer Take-Home Assessment (React / Next.js)

## Objective
This assessment is designed to evaluate your ability to convert designs into clean, responsive, production-ready frontend code using React/Next.js.

The focus is on **UI accuracy, component structure, state handling, and code quality** — not backend complexity.

## Product Context
You are building a **simple crypto checkout experience** that can be **embedded on any website** (similar to Stripe Checkout but crypto-payment checkout).

The checkout allows a user to:
- Review payment details
- Enter required information
- Complete a payment flow


## Design
Use the Figma design below as a reference:

🔗 **Figma Design:**  
https://www.figma.com/design/FRfbMHys4JINX4V9qBxgbf/Frontend-Assessment?node-id=0-1


## Task
Select **any 2 pages/screens** from the Figma design and convert them into code.

You are free to choose which two pages you think best demonstrate your skills.


## Technical Requirements
- Use **React.js or Next.js**
- TypeScript is preferred
- Responsive design (desktop + mobile)
- Clean component structure
- Basic form state handling
- Reasonable accessibility practices


## Functional Expectations
- Components should reflect the design closely
- Forms should capture input and manage state
- Buttons and interactions should behave logically
- No backend integration required (mock data is fine)


## Nice-to-Have (Optional)
These are optional and considered a bonus:
- Reusable components
- Basic form validation
- Simple loading or error states
- Thoughtful folder structure


## What to Submit
- GitHub repository link
- Vercel/Netlify Demo Link (A video demo via Loom or Jam.dev is also fine)
- README including:
  - Setup instructions
  - Any assumptions or trade-offs made


## Time Expectation
- **Estimated effort:** 4–6 hours
- **Deadline:** 24 hours from receiving this assessment


## Notes
- Do not overengineer
- Focus on clarity, structure, and UI quality
- Pixel-perfect is important as clean, maintainable code
